1. RECTANGULAR ROOM WITH UNKNOWN SIZE:

Randomized Agent:
- Performance: POOR
- Issues: No adaptation to room dimensions, random movement may be inefficient
- Impact: High energy consumption, low success rate

Simple Reflex Agent:
- Performance: FAIR
- Issues: Basic wall avoidance helps, but no systematic exploration
- Impact: Moderate energy consumption, moderate success rate
- Mitigation: Could benefit from room size detection

Model-Based Reflex Agent:
- Performance: POOR
- Issues: Assumes square room, systematic exploration fails
- Impact: May get stuck or miss areas, high energy consumption
- Mitigation: Needs adaptive exploration algorithms
